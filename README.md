# Rodent Manual Scorer

**A free, open-source desktop tool for manual behavioural video scoring.**

Developed by Diego Hassan Mediane

## What is it?

Rodent Manual Scorer is a Python-based application that lets researchers score behaviours in video recordings frame-by-frame, in real time. You assign keyboard keys to behaviours (e.g. `G` for *Grooming*, `F` for *Freezing*), play the video, and hold down the corresponding key whenever that behaviour occurs. The tool records start time, end time, and duration for every event, and exports everything to CSV or Excel.

It is designed to be simple enough for complete beginners while being precise enough for rigorous research.

## Features

- ⌨️ **Custom key-to-behaviour mapping** — assign any key to any behaviour
- ⏱️ **Automatic timing** — millisecond-accurate start/end/duration recording
- 🔢 **Multiple phases** — split a session into named experimental phases (e.g. Baseline, Treatment)
- 📊 **Timeline visualisation** — see all scored events overlaid on a progress bar
- ↩️ **Undo / Redo** — `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y`
- 💾 **Autosave** — saves a recovery CSV every 5 minutes automatically

## Which script should I use?

| Your computer | Script to use |
|---|---|
| **macOS** | `VideoTimer.py` |
| **Windows** | `VideoTimerWindows.py` |

The two scripts are functionally identical. The Windows version includes additional fixes for Windows-specific video backend quirks.
